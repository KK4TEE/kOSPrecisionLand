Unzip the files and place them in the scripts directory, then from the launchpad run barge.ks (The Boost Back program). If you're on the pad it will launch the rocket like a normal mission, otherwise it will attempt a final landing sequence. Take a look at runmodes.ks to see the various modes it runs in. Be sure to set a target ship to land on before running the latest code, or change the landingtargetLATLNG variable in library.KS/function GYROINIT to your LAT/LNG of choice. Enjoy!
