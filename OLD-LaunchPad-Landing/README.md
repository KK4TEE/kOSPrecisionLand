Unzip the files and place them in the scripts directory, then from the launchpad run bb.ks (The Boost Back program). If you're on the pad it will launch the rocket like a normal mission, otherwise it will attempt a final landing sequence. Take a look at runmodes.ks to see the various modes it runs in. Also note that some of this was quickly hacked/tweaked just to get it to work, and there are probably better ways to do things. That said, enjoy!
